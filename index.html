						<p class="style3">
						Roughly 80 million people around the world, including 3 million Americans, are currently diagnosed with glaucoma, the leading cause of irreversible blindness.
						(Davuluru et. al) The primary treatment of glaucoma involves the daily application of eye drops to reduce intraocular pressure and prevent the progression of the disease.
						However, the process of self-administering eye drops presents a significant challenge for many patients, particularly the elderly, due to issues such as difficulty in aiming the drops and dispensing the accurate amount of drops due to bottle variance.
						This often leads to improper dosage, patient frustration, and waste of medication and money. Therefore, the objective of this project is to design and engineer an automated eye drop dispenser device to assist with the application of eye drops.
						This solution aims to simplify the eye drop application process, ensuring that patients can administer their medication independently, accurately, and efficiently.
						The ultimate objective is to enhance the quality of life for glaucoma patients, ease the treatment process, and potentially reduce the waste of eye drops and money.</p>
