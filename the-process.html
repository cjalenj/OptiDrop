										<h2>Glaucoma patients will buy a hands-free eye drop applicator because it will alleviate frustrations arising from functional difficulties and wasted medication.</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Through customer discovery and research into the area and problem space, the team developed several hypotheses revolving around elderly people applying eye drops. It was presumed that many people would have trouble squeezing and lifting the bottle due to conditions like arthritis and other motor function impairment. In reality, it was revealed through patient interviews that squeezing the bottle is much less of a frustration for the patients, but rather the aiming and accurately dropping solution in the eye, as well as difficulty keeping their hand still when applying the eye drop. These concerns have less to do with conditions like arthritis and more to do with the general trends of aging and motor function and sensory impairment. It was also determined that many patients have trouble getting to the right angle for an easy drop. Conventionally, most people tilt their head back so their eyes are right under the eye drop bottle tip, but many patients had difficulties with the leaning back of the head, often resorting to options like lying down or using a special chair, and both of these habits get in the way of them being able to live their everyday life while using their eye drop medication, because they have become bound to the bed or chair that they need to apply their eye drops.</p>
									<p>It was thought that patients would have a high sensitivity and opinion around the high pricing of glaucoma prescription eye drops, as they are often in the $300-600 range for very small bottles, but that seemed to not be prominent in patients minds when asked about their frustrations with their eye drops. But through further investigation during the customer discovery, many of the patients admitted that they have run out of eye drops, due to them missing their eye and the wasting of drops, and when they did they had to pay out of pocket as the additional prescription was not covered by their insurance. When this memory of theirs was brought up, you could see the negative emotions rehashing within them, and the frustration was clear but it seemed to revolve more around them missing their eye and wasting drops, rather than around frustrations regarding the size or price of the glaucoma medication bottle. </p>
									<p>The value proposition to provide to chronic eye drop users revolves around accuracy of the eye drops when applied, and the minimization of wasted drops. Due to the high rate of missing drops and waste amongst elderly glaucoma patients interviewed, as well as the extremely high rate of use for these patients (some patients taking upwards of 30 drops a day),  the team in building an accurate and reliable system to help chronic eye drop users simplify this process and never miss or waste a drop again. Many of the patients interviewed during customer discovery have been using eye drops for decades, some even upwards of 50 years straight. Everyday, for decades, these people have been refining and practicing their eye drop application process, and after all these years these patients still miss their eye and waste drops running down their face. When the patients describe it, it is clearly an age old frustration for them, for they have been trying to lock this process down for decades, and after all these years they still miss their eye and they still feel like they don’t have complete control over the process and its success.</p>
									<p>There are many products on Amazon and across the internet that are trying to service this need, but ratings tend to be subpar signifying serious issues by Amazon standards. More specifics are competing products are to come in section 5. When asking patients current devices and solutions to their problems, a few brought up some products on the market that they’ve tried, but they complained a lot about the functionality and lack of effectiveness in the eye drop applier products that they tried. A reliable, simple, and easy to use solution could take ownership of this problem space and become a viable product and solution for chronic eye drop users.</p>

					<div class="title">Design Concept Ideation</div>

									<p>The development of the OptiDrop system is a response to significant challenges faced by users in administering eye drops: accurate drop dispensing and precise drop alignment. The ideation process, guided by a Pugh chart and FRDPAARC analysis, has led to a design concept that aims to improve the user experience by ensuring accuracy, ease, and compatibility.</p>
									<p>Using the ideation technique of a Pugh Chart, three design concepts are analyzed for achieving the OptiDrop's desired functions. The Pugh Chart (Table 6) helps compare potential designs, prioritizing simplicity, reliability, budget, and user-friendliness. Design 1 involves nano-sensors that are able to accurately sense the eye and signal the eye drop holder to move along a belt track on the top frame of the glasses and dispense according to the detection of the eye location. This complex system is the most efficient and convenient as there would be little to no user-interaction. However, this sensor system significantly increases the budget and makes the product become an extremely unreasonable cost for the target audience. There is also a risk of sensor malfunctioning. Design 2 is simplified to have a one time calibration for the client to manually adjust the positioning of the eye drop holder along the track to align with their right and left eye. This data is stored in an app, and there is no need for the client to move the holder in the future. However, this design doesn’t have a reasonable eye drop dispensing system. Design 3 has the same calibration system as Design 2, but it includes an air compressor system that uses pressure to force a drop into the client’s eye in a horizontal manner. This system not only addresses the challenge of effectively dispensing a drop into the eye, but also prevents the need for head tilting and reduces discomfort that many patients face when leaning back.</p>
									<p>Design 1, while technologically advanced, scores lower on the Pugh Chart in Table 6 due to its high cost and complexity, making it less accessible to the target audience. Design 2 improves on cost and simplicity but lacks in providing a comprehensive solution for drop dispensing. Design 3 is the most balanced, offering a simplified user interaction and involves an effective drop delivering method through a pressure system for drop delivery and a one-time manual calibration, making it the preferred design according to the Pugh Chart.</p>
									<p>The FRDPAARC chart (Table 7) identifies critical design considerations in the OptiDrop design 3 system. This final design features a wearable glasses frame with an integrated belt track that is calibrated one time by the client to position an eye drop holder in direct alignment to the client’s eyes. An app is used to store calibration data of the client's eye position, allowing the eye drop holder to always move on the track to the correct locations during future use.  The eye drop holder is adaptable and able to automatically constrict various common eye drop bottle sizes. The wearable is also equipped with a sensor for drop detection and air compressor system to horizontally dispense drops directly into the eye. Activation buttons are positioned on each temple to signal the eye drop dispensing system. The client will also be able to use the app to facilitate drop dispensation.</p>
									<p>One of the primary functions, precise drop delivery, aims to consistently dispense one drop at a time, countering the common issues of over-dispensing and difficulty squeezing bottles identified in the customer discovery phase. OptiDrop integrates an adjustable constrictor mechanism to accommodate varying bottle pressures and ensure accurate dispensation. This is combined with an automated pressure system to effectively dispense one drop at a time horizontally into the eye. The design's effectiveness relies on its mechanical adaptability, sensor precision, and ease of use. Ergonomic considerations and user feedback are important for refining the user interface. The approach is based on insights from customer discovery and existing studies highlighting the challenges faced by the target demographic of elderly glaucoma patients. Key risks include variability in drop size due to different bottle designs and the technical challenge of achieving consistent sensor and pressure accuracy. Countermeasures involve advanced calibration of sensors, ergonomic design for wearability, numerous testing with the air compression system to ensure efficient drop delivery, and experimentation with a range of eye drop bottles to ensure universal compatibility.</p>

									<p>There were many important concepts that were identified in customer discovery that needed to be addressed in the product design. The main points that were reciprocated by many of the glaucoma was issues with having to bend their neck back, issues with squeezing the bottle, and issues with dispensing too many drops causing medication to be wasted and to run out sooner, creating an out-of-pocket uninsured medical cost. Through empirical review of our customer discovery interviews, the most prevalent issue amongst glaucoma patients was the issue with dispensing too many drops, followed by their issue with squeezing the bottle, and lastly followed by issues with bending their neck back to apply medication at the correct angle. The design of the product should answer those customer needs in that order.</p>
									<p>Design 1 was centered around being able to dispense the eyedrop medication completely autonomously. The idea revolved around a wearable device that when put on, calibrates to the users eye by remote sensing the cornea, and moving the dropper and constrictor to that exact location. Then using remote sensing again, a sensor reading would notify the device that the user’s eyes are open and not closed, and when the device is notified the drop immediately dispenses fully autonomously and hands free. This approach had many issues functionally though. This approach would still require the bending of the neck since users would need to wear a glasses like wearable, and since the drop had to be dispensed out of the prescribed dropper, and there could be no medium of storage in between the dropper and the eye due to FDA regulations, this product design still did not address one of the key needs for the customer base. This design was also not electronically feasible, as the heavy reliance on remote sensing made it very difficult to time things correctly, and this was realized during the testing of the LiDAR module, because it became apparent after extensive trials that it was nearly impossible to accurately and reliably identify the cornea. From here it became clear that full automation of this process may be out of reach using low cost electronic parts. But it also became clear what parts of the process needed to be manual or user assisted/prompted. Further comparison between the manual and automated dropped methods is analyzed in the decision matrix (Table 8) located in the appendix. The calibration for aiming the dropper and the squeezing of the bottle became the immediate needs for manual use, and the rest of the system was to be automated in the next design iteration.</p>
									<p>Design 2 that was explored contained many of the components of the initial design, particularly the frame design around a wearable, sunglasses like device, that uses a constrictor to squeeze the eyedropper hands-free, and uses LiDAR to sense the amount of medication coming out of the eye dropper to control the constrictor to not dispense more than one drop. In this design iteration, the squeezing of the eye dropper was to be done manually by the user, and the aiming and aligning was dependent on finding the center of the eye by identifying the space between the eyelids by using a distance sensor, using radar rather than LiDAR. This process consisted of finding the top and bottom eyelids by identifying the change in distance that occurs between the tip of the eyelid and the beginning of the eye surface, which is slightly past the eyelid. Comparisons between using LiDAR and Radar in our design can be further analyzed in the decision matrix (Table 8) located in the appendix. This method of remote sensing was slightly more easy to work with programmatically, but still generally difficult and unpredictable when it came to aiming for the center of the eye. Issues that were prevalent were often due to the sampling rate and the resolution of the reading, as the radar module did not sample fast enough to keep up with the movement of the track that was doing the alignment of the dropper and constrictor, by the time the radar triggered the system to stop, the constrictor was often beyond the surface of the eye, particularly when calibrating up and down from top eyelid to bottom eyelid. This design, similar to the previous design, did not address the customer's need of not requiring the bending of the head back. This was an important customer request due to the age of the customer base.</p>
									<p>Design 3, the final design, that is being explored contains most of the components of the previous design iteration, but with an important additional feature and part, revolving around the use of an air compressor. After testing the performance of an air compressor dispersing air horizontally to the ground, between 1 to 1.4 psi of air pressure the drop would fly horizontally and accurately at a target at a 4 inch distance after being dispersed from the eyedropper. There was also testing of the same phenomena using an air fan, since the compressor seemed to be harder to line up, harder to power, more bulky, and complex. More analysis on the comparison between air fan and air compressor can be seen in the decision matrix (Table 8) located in the appendix. But the fan did not achieve the performance of the air compressor at all, and with proper alignment, the air compressor had nearly the reliability of the fan but with far greater accuracy, and due to the low psi required the power consumption increase was negligible. Additionally, the calibration of finding the center of the eye was offloaded to a mobile application that syncs with the device, scans the person’s face, and control the two linear tracks for up and down movement to properly calibrate with the user’s face to find the center of the eye, and additionally this calibration will be stored in the app and saved per user face, which will allow much of the required processing and memory required to be offloaded to a mobile phone, which will greatly reduce the clocking of the microprocessor and the height of the memory stack, which were both significant technical limitations when attempting to test design modules together in tangent. Additionally, the use of the air compressor now allows users to not have to bend their neck back when they use the device, because the air compressor shoots the drop horizontally into the eye at a high accuracy and reliability. Using air to manipulate the drop is also the only FDA regulated way to change the path of the drop. A potential product risk here arises from the fact that the air compressor shoots air nearly directly into the eye of the users. After testing this on several test users, it became clear that the effect of the air was noticeable, and some said slightly uncomfortable at times. But due to the low psi and slow rate, the feeling was negligible.</p>
									<p>After testing and analyzing certain mechanisms and design concepts, a preliminary CAD model is created to depict the final design concept (figure 1). It shows a general perspective of the eye drop holder/constrictor mechanism and air compressor system placement on the wearable frame. More advanced designs of each subsystem and additional features such as the track are in the process of being modeled and rendered in SolidWorks. The bill of materials (Table 1) outlines the cost of each feature in the final design concept and everything is currently within budget. Adjustments to the CAD and bill of materials are constantly adjusted throughout experimentation and prototyping to correspond to any design and engineering changes.</p>
